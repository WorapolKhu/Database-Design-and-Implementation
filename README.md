# Database-Design-and-Implementation
Design and implement a central relational database system for a coffee shop chain expanding nationally, streamlining operations and enabling data-driven decisions.

## Scenario
In this scenario, I have recently been hired as a Data Engineer by a New York-based coffee shop chain looking to expand nationally by opening several franchise locations. They want to streamline operations and revamp their data infrastructure as part of their expansion process.

My job is to design their relational database systems for improved operational efficiencies and make it easier for their executives to make data-driven decisions.

Currently, their data resides in several systems: accounting software, supplier databases, point of sales (POS) systems, and even spreadsheets. I will review the data in all of these systems and design a central database to house all of the data. I will then create the database objects and load them with source data. Finally, I will create subsets of data my business partners require, export them, and load them into staging databases using several RDBMS.

## Objectives
- Identify entities
- Identity attributes
- Create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) using the pgAdmin ERD tool
- Normalize tables
- Define keys and relationships
- Create database objects by generating and running the SQL script from the ERD tool
- Create a view and export the data
- Create a materialized view and export the data
  - Import data into a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin GUI tool
  - Import data into a MySQL database

## Requirements
-  PostgreSQL Database
-  MySQL
